# Exploring Socioeconomic Determinants of Crime Outcomes in Chicago  

This project analyzes the relationship between socioeconomic factors and the **Successful Arrest Rate (SAR)** across Chicago’s 77 community areas from 2002 to 2022. The SAR is defined as the proportion of reported crimes that result in an arrest.  

## Overview  
Using data from the **Chicago Police Department**, **U.S. Census Bureau**, and the **Illinois Department of Public Health**, I built a dataset covering more than 1,600 observations. I applied statistical models in Python to study how poverty, unemployment, education, and healthcare relate to arrest outcomes, alongside crime report and arrest data.  

## Key Insights  
- Socioeconomic variables showed only small effects on arrest outcomes.  
- The number of reports and arrests were far stronger predictors of SAR.  
- Visualizations highlighted the steady decline in SAR across most communities over the past two decades.  
- Results suggest the need for more comprehensive socioeconomic data when analyzing crime outcomes.  

## Tools & Skills  
- **Python (pandas, statsmodels, matplotlib)**  
- **Statistical Modeling (multiple linear regression)**  
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
- **Data Visualization (time-series, heatmaps, geospatial maps)**  
- **Socioeconomic & Policy Analysis**

## Purpose  
This project combined technical data analysis with policy-focused research. It helped me strengthen my ability to work with large, real-world datasets and translate complex results into clear, actionable insights.
